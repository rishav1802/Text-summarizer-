The Proverbs of
Administration
Herbert A. Simon

A fact about proverbs that greatly enhances their
quotability is that they almost always occur in
mutually contradictory pairs. “Look before you
leap!”——but “He who hesitates is lost”

This is both a convenience and a serious
defect—depending on the use to which one
wishes to put the proverbs in question. If it is a
matter of rationalizing behavior that has already
taken place or justifying action that has already
been decided upon, proverbs are ideal. Since
one is never at a loss to find one that will prove
his point—or the precisely contradictory point,
for that matter—they are a great help in persua-
sion, political debate, and all forms of rhetoric.

But when one seeks to use proverbs as the
basis of a scientific theory, the situation is less
happy. It is not that the propositions expressed
by the proverbs are insufficient, it is rather that
they prove too much. A scientific theory should
tell what is true but also what is false. If Newton
had announced to the world that particles of
matter exert either an attraction or a repulsion
on each other, he would not have added much
to scientific knowledge. His contribution con-
sisted in showing that an attraction was
exercised and in announcing the precise law
governing its operation.

Most of the propositions that make up the
body of administrative theory today share,
unfortunately, this defect of proverbs. For
almost every principle one can find an equally
plausible and acceptable contradictory princi-
ple. Although the two principles of the pair
will lead to exactly opposite organizational

recommendations, there is nothing in the the-
ory to indicate which is the proper one to apply.*

It is the purpose of this paper to substantiate
the sweeping criticism of administrative theory,
and to present some suggestions—perhaps less
concrete than they should be—as to how the
existing dilemma can be solved.

Some Accepted
Administrative Principles

Among the more common principles that occur
in the literature of administration are these:

Administrative efficiency is increased by a
specialization of the task among the group.
Administrative efficiency is increased by
arranging the members of the group in a
determinate hierarchy of authority.
Administrative efficiency is increased by
limiting the span of control at any point in
the hierarchy to a srnall number.
Administrative efficiency is increased by
grouping the workers, for purposes of
control, according to (2) purpose, (b) pro-
cess, (c) clientele, (d ) place. (This is really
an elaboration of the first principle but
deserves separate discussion.)

Since these principles appear relatively
simple and clear, it would seem that their
application to concrete problems of adminis-
trative organization would be unambiguous
and that their validity would be easily sub-
mitted to empirical test. Such, however,
seems not to be the case. To show why it is
not, each of the four principles just listed will
be considered in turn.

Specialization Administrative efficiency is
supposed to increase with an increase in
specialization. But is this intended to mean that
any increase in, specialization will increase eff-
ciency? Ifso, which of the foliowing alternatives
is the correct application of the Principle in a
particular case?
136

1. Aplan of nursing should be put into effect
by which nurses will be assigned to dis-
tricts and do al] nursing within that dis-
trict, including school examinations, visits
to homes of school children, and tubercu-
losis nursing.

2. A functional plan of nursing should be put
into effect by which different nurses will be
assigned to school exarninations, visits to
homes of school children, and tuberculosis
nursing. The present method of general-
ized nursing by districts impedes the
development of specialized skills in the
three very diverse programs.

Both of these administrative arrangements
satisfy the requirement of specialization—the
first provides specialization by place; the sec-
ond, specialization by function. The principles
of specialization is of no help at all in choosing
between the two alternatives.

It appears that the simplicity of the principle
of specialization is a deceptive simplicity—a
simplicity which conceals fundamental ambi-
guities. For “specialization” is not a condition of
efficient administration; it is an inevitable char-
acteristic of all group effort; however efficient or
inefficient that effort may be. Specialization
merely means that different persons are doing
different things—and since it is physically
impossible for two persons to be doing the
same thing in the same place at the same time,
two persons are always doing different things.

The real problem of administration, then, is
not to “specialize,” but to specialize in that par-
ticular manner and along those particular lines
which will lead to administrative efficiency. But,
in thus rephrasing this “principle? of
administration, there has been. brought clearly
into the open its fundamental ambiguity:
“Administrative efficiency is increased by a spe-
cialization of the task among the group in the
direction which will lead to greater efficiency?

Purther discussion of the choice between
competing bases of specialization will be under-
taken after two other principles of administra-
tion have been examined.

Unity of Command Administrative effi-
ciency is supposed to be enhanced by arranging
the members of the organization in a determi-

nate hierarchy of authority in order to
“unity of command” Preseryy

Analysis of this “principle” requires 4 dl
understanding of what is meant by the , =
“authority.” A subordinate may be gaig ;
accept authority whenever he permits 1.
behavior to be guided by a decision reached by
another, irrespective of his own judgment 88 ty
the merits of that decision.

In one sense the principle of unity of com.
mand, like the principle of specialization
cannot be violated; for it is physically imposs.
ble for a man to obey two contradicin
commands—that is what is meant by “contra.
dictory commands.” Presumably, if unity of
command is a principle of administration, jt
must assert something more than this physical
impossibility. Perhaps it asserts this: that it is
undesirable to place a member of an organiza.
tion in a position where he receives orders from
more than one superior. This is evidently the
meaning that Gulick attaches to the principle
when he says,

The significance of this principle in the pro-
cess of co-ordination and organization must
not be lost sight of. In building a structure of
co-ordination, it is often tempting to set up
more than one boss for a man who is doing
work which has more than one relationship.
Even as great a philosopher of management
as Jaylor fell into this error in setting up sep-
arate foremen to deal with machinery, with
materials, with speed, etc, each with the
power of giving orders directly to the ind
vidual workman. The rigid adherence to the
principle of unity of command may have ®
absurdities; these are, however, unimportant
in comparison with the certainty of conf
sion, inefficiency and irresponsibility whi a
arise from the violation of the principle:
Certainly the principle of unity of co™
mand, thus interpreted, cannot be criticized °
any lack of clarity or any ambiguity. The defor
tion of authority given above should provide*
clear test whether, in any concrete situatio?
principle is observed. The real fault that must .
found with this principle is that it is incompa™”
ble with the principle of specialization. O° —
the most important uses to which authorlY ,
Article 18 | The Proverbs of Administration | 137

put in an organization is to bring about special-
ization in the work of making decisions, so that
each decision is made at a point in the organiza-
tion where it can be made most expertly: As a
result, the use of authority permits a greater
degree of expertness to be achieved in decision
making than would be possible if each operative
employee had himself to make all the decisions
upon which his activity is predicated. The indi-
vidual fireman does not decide whether to use
a two-inch hose or a fire extinguisher; that is
decided for him by his officers, and the decision
is communicated to him in the form of a
command.

However, if unity of command, in Gulicks
sense, is observed, the decisions of a person at
any point in the administrative hierarchy are
subject to influence through only one channel
of authority; and if his decisions are of a kind
that require expertise in more than one field of
knowledge, then advisory and informational
services must be relied upon to supply those
premises which lie in a field not recognized by
the mode of specialization in the organization,
For example, if an accountant in a school
department is subordinate to an educator, and if
unity of command is observed, then the finance
department cannot issue direct orders to him
regarding the technical, accounting aspects of
his work. Similarly, the director of motor vehi-
cles in the public works department will be
unable to issue direct orders on care of motor
equipment to the fire-truck driver?

Gulick, in the statement quoted above,
clearly indicates the difficulties to be faced if
unity of command is not observed. A certain
amount of irresponsibility and confusion are
almost certain to ensue. But perhaps this is not
too great a price to pay for the increased exper-
tise that can be applied to decisions. What is
needed to decide the issue is a principle of
administration that would enable one to weigh
the relative advantages of the two courses of
action. But neither the principle of unity of
command nor the principle of specialization is
helpful in adjudicating the controversy. They
merely contradict each other without indicating
any procedure for resolving the contradiction.

If this were merely an academic
controversy—if it were generally agreed and

had been generally demonstrated that unity of
command must be preserved in all cases, even
with a loss in expertise—one could assert that
in case of conflict between the two principles,
unity of command should prevail. But the issue
is far from clear, and experts can be ranged on
both sides of the controversy, On the side of
unity of command there may be cited the dic-
tums of Gulick and others.* On the side of
specialization there are ‘Taylor's theory of func-
tional supervision, Macmahon and Millets
idea of “dual supervision,” and the practice of
technical supervision in military organization,>

It may be, as Gulick asserts, that the notion
of Taylor and these others is an “error” If so, the
evidence that it is an error has never been mar-
shalled or published—apart from loose heuris-
tic arguments like that quoted above. One is left
with a choice between equally eminent theorists
of administration and without any evidential
basis for making that choice,

What evidence there is of actual adminis-
trative practice would seem to indicate that the
need for specialization is to a very large degree
given priority over the need for unity of com-
mand. As a matter of fact, it does not go too far
to say that unity of command, in Gulicks
sense, never has existed in any administrative
organization. Ifa line officer accepts the regu-
lations of an accounting department with
regard to the procedure for making requisi-
tions, can it be said that, in this sphere, he is
not subject to the authority of the accounting
department? In any actual administrative situ-
ation authority is zoned, and to maintain that
this zoning does not contradict the principle of
unity of command requires a very different
definition of authority from that used here.
This subjection of the line officer to the
accounting department is no different, in prin-
ciple, from Taylor's recommendation that in
the matter of work programming a workman
be subject to one foreman, in the matter of
machine operation to another.

The principle of unity of command is per-
haps more defensible if narrowed down to the
following: In case two authoritative commands
conflict, there should be a single determinate
person whom the subordinate is expected to
obey; and the sanctions of authority should be
138 Part Two | The New Deal to Mid-Century { 1930s To igsos :

applied against the subordinate only to enforce
his obedience to that one person.

If the principle of unity of command is more
defensible when stated in this limited form, it
also solves fewer problems. In the first place, it
no longer requires, except for settling conflicts
of authority, a single hierarchy of authority:
Consequently, it leaves unsettled the very
important question of how authority should be
zoned in a particular organization (ie, the
modes of specialization) and through what
channels it should be exercised. Finally, even
this narrower concept of unity of command
conflicts with the principle of specialization, for
whenever disagreement does occur and the
organization members revert to the formal lines
of authority, then only those types of specializa-
tion which are represented in the hierarchy of
authority can impress themselves on a decision,
If the training officer of a city exercises only
functional supervision over the police training
officer, then in case of disagreement with the
police chief, specialized knowledge of police
problems will determine the outcome while
specialized knowledge of training problems will
be subordinated or ignored. That this actually
occurs is shown by the frustration so com-
monly expressed by fimctional supervisors at
their lack of authority to apply sanctions.

Span of Control Administrative efficiency
is supposed to be enhanced by limiting
the number of subordinates who report
directly to any one administrator to a small
number—say six, This notion that the “span
of control” should be narrow is confidently
asserted as a third incontrovertible principle
of administration. The usual common-sense
arguments for restricting the span of control
are farniliar and need not be repeated here.
What is not so generally recognized is that a
contradictory proverb of administration can
be stated which, though it is not so familiar
as the principle of span of control, can be
supported by arguments of equal plausibility.
The proverb in question is the following:
Administrative efficiency is enhanced by
keeping at a minimum the number of orga-
nizational levels through which a matter
roust pass before it is acted upon.

This latter proverb is one of the fun,
criteria that guide administrative anah at
procedures simplification work. Yet in iy
situations the results to which this print
leads are in direct contradiction to the re “Dl
ments of the principle of span of contro] -
principle of unity of command, and the p : the
ple of specialization, The present discuce
concerned with the first of these conflicts t
illustrate the difficulty, two alternative ropes.
als for the organization of a small health depar,
ment will be presented—one based On the
resiriction of span of control, the other on the
limitation of number of organization ley :

1, The present organization of the depart.
ment places an administrative overload an
the health officer by reason of the fact thet
all eleven employees of the department
report directly to him and the firrther fg
that some of the staff lack adequate techni.
cal training. Consequently, venereal
disease clinic treatments and other details
require an undue amount of the health
officer's personal attention.

Tt has previously been recommended
that the proposed medical officer be
placed in charge of the venereal disease
and chest clinics and all child hygiene
work. It is further recommended that
one of the inspectors be designated chief
inspector and placed in charge of all the
department’s inspectional activities and
that one of the nurses be designated a
head nurse. This will relieve the healt
commissioner of considerable detail and
will leave him greater freedom to plan and
supervise the health program as a whole
to conduct health education, and to coor
dinate the work of the department with
that of other community agencies. if the
department were thus organized, the
fectiveness of all employees could be subr
stantially increased. at

2, The present organization of the dep4
ment leads to inefficiency and exc if
red tape by reason of the fact that “
unnecessary supervisory level interve™™
between the health officer and the Oe
tive employees, and that those four ©
Article 18 + The Proverbs of Administration i 139

twelve employees who are best trained
technically are engaged largely in “over-

_ head” administrative duties, Consequently,
unnecessary delays occur in securing the
approval of the health officer on matters
requiring his attention, and too many mat-
ters require review and review.

The medical officer should be left in
charge of the venereal disease and chest
clinics and child hygiene work. It is recom-
mended, however, that the position of
chief inspector and head nurse be abol-
ished and that the employees naw filling
these positions perform regular inspec-
tional and nursing duties. The details of
work scheduling now handled by these
two employees can be taken care of more
economically by the secretary to the health
officer, and, since broader matters of policy
have, in any event, always required the
personal attention of the health officer, the
abolition of these two positions will elimi-
nate a wholly unnecessary step in review,
will allow an expansion of inspectional and
nursing services, and will permit at least a
beginning to be made in the recom-
mended program of health education. The
nurober of persons reporting directly to
the health officer will be increased to nine,
but since there are few matters requiring
the coordination of these employees, other
than the work schedules and policy ques-
tions referred to above, this change will not
materially increase his work load.

The dilemma is this: in a large organization
with complex interrelations between members,
a restricted span of control inevitably produces
excessive red tape, for each contact between
organization members must be carried upward
until a common superior is found. If the organi-
zation is at ali large, this will involve carrying all
such matters upward through several levels of
officials for decision and then downward again
in the form of orders and instructions—a cum-
bersome and time-consuming process.

The alternative is to increase the number of
persons who are under the command of each
officer, so that the pyrarnid will come more rap-
idly to a peak, with fewer intervening levels. But

this, too, leads to difficulty, for if an officer is
required to supervise too many employees, his
control over them is weakened.

If it is granted, then, that both the increase
and the decrease in span of control has
some undesirable consequences, what is the
optimum point? Proponents of a restricted
span of control have suggested three, five, even
eleven, as suitable numbers, but nowhere have
they explained the reasoning which led them
to the particular number they selected. The
principle as stated casts no light on this very
crucial question. One is reminded of current
arguments about the proper size of the
national debt.

Organization by Purpose, Process, Clientele,
Place Administrative efficiency is supposed to
be increased by grouping workers according
to (a) purpose, (6) process, {c) clientele, or
{d) place. But from the discussion of specializa-
tion it is clear that this principle is internally
inconsistent; for purpose, process, clientele, and
place are competing bases of organization, and
at any given point of division the advantages of
three must be sacrificed to secure the advan-
tages of the fourth. If the major departments of
a City, for example, are organized on the basis of
major purpose, then it follows that all the physi-
cians, all the lawyers, all the engineers, all the
Statisticians will not be located in a single
department exclusively composed of members
of their profession but will be distributed among
the various city departments needing their
services. The advantages of organization by
process will thereby be partly lost.

Some of these advantages can be regained
by organizing on the basis of process within the
major departments. Thus there may be an
engineering bureau within the public works
department, or the board of education may
have a school health service as a major division
of its work. Similarly, within smaller units there
may be division by area or by clientele: e.g, fire
department will have separate companies
located throughout the city while a welfare
department may have intake and case work
agencies in various locations. Again, however,
these major types of specialization cannot be
simultaneously achieved, for at any point in the
140

organization it must be decided whether spe-
cialization at the next level will be accom-
plished by distinction of major purpose, major
process, clientele, or area.

The conflict may be illustrated by showing
how the principle of specialization according to
purpose would lead to a different result from
specialization according to clientele in the orga-
nization of a health department.

1. Public health administration consists of
the following activities for the prevention
of disease and the maintenance of health-
ful conditions: (1) vital statistics; (2) child
hygiene—prenatal, maternity, posinatal,
infant, preschool, and school health pro-
grams; (3) communicable disease control;
(4) inspection of milk, foods, and drugs;
(5) sanitary inspection; (6) laboratory ser-
vice; (7) health education.

One of the handicaps under which the
health department labors is the fact that
the department has no control over school
health, that being an activity of the county
board of education, and there is little or no
coordination between that highly impor-
tant part of the community health pro-
gram and the balance of the program
which is conducted by the city-county
health unit. It is recommended that the
city and county open negotiations with the
board of education for the transfer of all
school health work and the appropriation
therefor to the joint health unit...

2, To the medern school department is
entrusted the care of children during
almost the entire period that they are
absent from the parental home. Ithas three
principal responsibilities toward them: {1}
to provide for their education in useful
skills and knowledge and in character; (2)
to provide them with wholesome play ac-
tivities outside school hours, (3) to care for
their health and to assure the attainment of
minimum standards of nutrition.

One of the handicaps under which the
school board labors is the fact that, except
for school lunches, the board has no con-
trol over child health and nutrition, and
there is little or no coordination between
that highly important part of the child

Here again is posed the dilemm, g
choosing between. alternative, equally pla,
sible, administrative principies. But this i
not the only difficulty in the present C880, foy
a closer study of the situation shows there are
fundamental ambiguities in the meanings of
the key items—“purpose,” “process” “lien,
tele? and “place.”

“Purpose” may be roughly defined as ip
objective or end for which an activity is carried
on; “process” as a means for accomplishing a
purpose. Processes, then, are carried on in
order to achieve purposes. But purposes them-
selves may generally be arranged in some sort
of hierarchy. A typist moves her fingers in order
to type; types in order to reproduce a letter
reproduces a letter in order that an inquiry may
be answered. Writing a letter is then the pur
pose for which the typing is performed; while
writing a letter is also the process whereby the
purpose of replying to an inquiry is achieved. It
follows that the same activity may be described
as purpose or as process.

This ambiguity is easily illustrated for the
case of an administrative organization. A health
department conceived as a unit whose taskits
to care for the health of the community isa pur
pose organization; the same department col
ceived as a unit which makes use of the medic
arts to carry on its work is a process organ
tion. In the same way, an education departmest
may be viewed as a purpose (to educate) om”
nization, or a clientele (children) organizatio®

tion), process (forest management), clier*

this sort are selected, the lines of demarcat®,
between these categories become very ha?Y a
unclear indeed. - «ns

“Organization by major purpose ws
Gullick, “ . . serves to bring together in 2°”,

Article 18 | The Proverbs of Administration | 141

endeavoring to render a particular service” But
what is a particular service? Is fire protection a
single purpose, or is it merely a part of the pur-
pose of public safety?—or is it a combination of
purposes including fire prevention and fire
fighting? It must be concluded that there is no
such thing as a purpose, or a unifunctional
(single-purpose} organization. What is to be
considered a single function depends entirely
on language and techniques.” If the English
language has a comprehensive term which cov-
ers both of two sub-purposes it is natural to
think of the two together as a single purpose. If
such a term is lacking, the two sub-purposes
become purposes in their own right. On the
other hand, a single activity may contribute to
several objectives, but since they are technically
{procedurally) inseparable, the activity is con-
sidered a single function or purpose.

The fact, mentioned previously, that pur-
poses form a hierarchy, each sub-purpose
contributing to some more final and compre-
hensive end, helps to make clear the relation
between purpose and process. “Organization by
major process,” says Gulick, “ . . tends to bring
together in a single department all of those who
are at work making use of a given special skill
or technology, or are members of a given pro-
fession”* Consider a simple skill of this kind—
typing. Typing is a skill which brings about a
means-end coordination of muscular move-
ments, but at a very low level in the means-end
hierarchy. The content of the typewritten letter
is indifferent to the skill that produces it, The
skill consists merely in the ability to hit the letter
“f” quickly whenever the letter “t” is required by
the content and to hit the letter “a” whenever
the letter “a” is required by the content.

There is, then, no essential difference
between a “purpose” and a “process” but only a
distinction of degree. A “process” is an activity
whose immediate purpose is at a low level in
the hierarchy of means and ends, while a “pur-
pose” isa collection of activities whose orienting
value or aim is at a high level in the means-end
hierarchy.

Next consider “clientele” and “place” as bases
of organization. These categories are really not
separate from purpose, but a part of it. A com-
Plete statement of the purpose of a fire depart-
ment would have to include the area served by

it: “to reduce fire losses on property in the city
of X° Objectives of an administrative organiza-
tion are phrased in terms of a service to be pro-
vided and an area for which it is provided,
Usually, the term “purpose” is meant to refer
only to the first element, but the second is fustas
legitimately an aspect of purpose. Area of ser-
vice, of course, may be a specified clientele quite
as well as a geographical area. In the case of an
agency which works on “shifts” time will be a
third dimension of purpose—to provide a given
service in a given area (or to a given clientele)
during a given time period.

With this clarification of terminology, the
next task is to reconsider the problem of spe-
cializing the work of an organization. It is no
longer legitimate to speak of a “purpose” orga-
nization, a “process” organization, a “clientele”
organization, or an “area” organization. The
Same unit might fall into any one of these four
categories, depending on the nature of the
larger organizational unit of which it wasa part.
A unit providing public health and medical ser-
vices for school-age children in Multnomah
County might be considered (1) an “area” orga-
nization if it were part of a unit providing the
same service for the state of Oregon; (2) a
“clientele” organization if it were part of a unit
providing similar services for children of all
ages; (3) a “purpose” or a “process” organization
{it would be impossible to say which) if it were
part of an education department.

It is incorrect to say that Bureau A is
a process bureau; the correct statement is
that Bureau A is a process bureau within
Department X.° This latter statement would
mean that Bureau A incorporates all the
processes of a certain kind in Department X,
without reference to any special subpurposes,
subareas, or subclientele of Department X. Now
it is conceivable that a particular unit might
incorporate all processes of a certain kind but
that these processes might relate to only certain
particular subpurposes of the department pur-
pose. In this case, which corresponds to the
health unit in an education department men-
tioned above, the unit would be specialized by
both purpose and process. The health unit
would be the only one in the education depart-
ment using the medical art (process) and
concerned with health (subpurpose).
142 Part Two | The New Deal to Mid-Century | 19305 To 1950s :

Even when the problem is solved of proper
usage for the terms “purpose,” “process;
“clientele,” and “area,” the principles of admin-
istration give no guide as to which of these
four competing bases of specialization is
applicable in any particular situation. The
British Machinery of Government Committee
had no doubts about the matter. It considered
purpose and clientele as the two possible bases
of organization and put its faith entirely in the
former. Others have had equal assurance in
choosing between purpose and process. The
reasoning which leads to these unequivocal
conclusions leaves something to be desired.
The Machinery of Government Committee
gives this sole argument for its choice:

Now the inevitable outcome of this method
of organization [by clientele] is a tendency to
Lilliputian administration. It is impossible
that the specialized service which each
Department has to render to the commu-
nity can be of as high a standard when its
work is at the same time limited to a particu-
lar class of persons and extended to every
variety of provision for them, as when the
Department concentrates itself on the provi-
sion of the particular service only by whom-
soever required, and looks beyond the
interest of comparatively small classes.!°

The faults in this analysis are obvious.
First, there is no attempt to determine how a
Service is to be recognized. Second, there is a
bald assumption, absolutely without proof,
that a child health unit, for example, in a
department of child welfare could not offer
services of “as high a standard” as the same
unit if it were located in a department of
health. Just how the shifting of the unit from
one department to another would improve or
damage the quality of its work is not
explained. Third, no basis is set forth for
adjudicating the competing claims of purpose
and process—the two are merged in the
ambiguous term “service” It is not necessary
here to decide whether the committee was
right or wrong in its recommendation; the
important point is that the recommendation
represented a choice, without any apparent
logical or empirical grounds, between contra-
dictory principles of administration.

 

Even more remarkable illustrations of it...
can be found in most discussions of pug
versus process. They would be tag tidicuion
cite if they were not commonly used in ser,
political and administrative debate. oes

who had extensive experience in agricultyry
research or as administrator of an agricultural
school, and staffed by men of similarly
appropriate background. What reason is there
to believe that if attached to a Ministry of
Education they would teach old-fashioned
farming by new-fashioned methods, while if
attached to a Ministry of Agriculture they
would teach new-fashioned farming by
old-fashioned methods? The administrative
problem of such a bureau would be to teach
new-fashioned farming by new-fashioned
methods, and it is a little difficult to see how
the departmental location of the unit would
affect this result. “The question answers
itself” only if one has a rather mystical faith in
the potency of bureau—shuffling as 2 means
for redirecting the activities of an agency.

These contradictions and competitions have
received increasing attention from students of
administration during the past few years. For
example, Gulick, Wallace, and Benson have
stated certain advantages and disadvantages of
the several modes of specialization, and hav?
considered the conditions under which one or
the other mode might best be adopted.“ Al
this analysis has been at a theoretical level “4

one-sidedness which characterizes the examples
quoted above or to inconclusiveness,

The Impasse of Administrative Theory The
four “principles of administration” that were set
forth at the beginning of this paper have now
been subjected to critical analysis. None of the
four survived in very good shape, for in each
case there was found, instead of an unequivocal
principle, a set of two or more mutually
incompatible principles apparently equally
applicable to the administrative situation.

Moreover, the reader will see that the very
same objections can be urged against the cus-
tomary discussions of “centralization” versus
“decentralization” which usually conclude, in
effect, that “on the one hand, centralization of
decision-making functions is desirable; on the
other hand, there are definite advantages in
decentralization”

Can anything be salvaged which will be
useful in the construction of an administrative
theory? As a matter of fact, almost everything
can be salvaged. The difficulty has arisen from
treating as “principles of administration” what
are really only criteria for describing and

diagnosing administrative situations. Closet -

space is certainly an important item in the
design of a successful house: yet a house
designed entirely with a view to securing
maximum of closet space—al! other consider-
ations being forgotten—would be considered,
to say the least, somewhat unbalanced.
Similarly, unity of command, specialization by
Purpose, decentralization are all items to be
considered in the design of an efficient admin-
istrative organization. No single one of these
items is of sufficient importance to suffice as a
guiding principle for the administrative ana-
lyst, In the design of administrative organiza-
tion, as in their operation, overall efficiency
must be the guiding criterion. Mutuaily
incompatible advantages must be balanced
against each other, just as an architect weighs
the advantages of additional closet space
against the advantages of a larger living room.
This position, if it is a valid one, constitutes

an indictment of much current writing about
inistrative matters. As the examples cited

in this chapter amply demonstrate, much
inistrative analysis proceeds by selecting a

single criterion and applying it to an adminis-
trative situation to reach a recommendation;
while the fact that equally valid, but contradic-
tory, criteria exist which could be applied with
equal reason, but with a different result, is con-
veniently ignored. A valid approach to the study
of administration requires that all the relevant
diagnostic criteria be identified; that each
administrative situation be analyzed in terms of
the entire set of criteria; and that research be
instituted to determine how weights can be
assigned to the several criteria when they are, as
they usually will be, mutually incompatible.

An Approach
to Administrative Theory

This program needs to be considered step by
Step. First, what is included in the description
of administrative situations for purposes of
such an. analysis? Second, how can weights be
assigned to the various criteria to give them
their proper place in the total picture?

The Description of Administrative Situa-
tions Before a science can develop principles, it
must possess concepts. Before a law of gravita-
tion could be formulated, it was hecessary to
have the notions of “acceleration” and “weight”
The first task of administrative theory is to de-
velop a set of concepts that will permit the
description in terms relevant to the theory, of
administrative situations. These concepts, to be
scientifically useful, roust be Operational; that is,
their meanings must correspond to empirically
observable facts or situations. The definition of
“authority” given earlier in this paper is an
example of an operational definition,

What is a scientifically relevant description
ofan organization? It isa description that, so far
as possible, designates for each persen in the
organization what decisions that person makes
and the influences to which he is subject in
making each of these decisions. Current
descriptions of administrative organizations fall
far short of this standard. For the most part,
they confine themselves to the allocation of
functions and the formal structure of ay thority.
They give little attention to the other types of

organizational influence or to the system of
communication.
144 Part Two | The New Deal to Mid-Century | 19308 TO 19508 :

What does it mean, for example, to say:
“The department is made up of three bureaus.
The first has the function of , the second
the function of , and the third the func-
tion of. 2” What can be learned from such
a description about the workability of the orga-
nizational arrangement? Very littie, indeed. For
from the description there is obtained no idea
of the degree to which decisions are centralized
at the bureau level or at the departmental level.
No notion is given as to the extent to which the
{presumably unlimited) authority of the depart-
ment over the bureau is actually exercised or by
what mechanisms. There is no indication of the
extent fo which systems of communication
assist the coordination of the three bureaus ox,
for that matter, to what extent coordination is
required by the nature of their work. There is no
description of the kinds of training the mem-
bers of the bureau have undergone or of the
extent to which this training permits decentral-
ization at the bureau level. In sum, a description
of administrative organizations in terms almost
exclusively of functions and lines of authority is
completely inadequate for purposes of adminis-
trative analysis,

Consider the term “centralization” How is it
determined whether the operations of a partic-
ular organization are “centralized” or “decen-
tralized”? Does the fact that field offices exist
prove anything about decentralization? Might
not the same decentralization take place in the
bureaus of a centrally located office? A realistic
analysis of centralization must include a study
of the allocation of decisions in the organization
and the methods of influence that are employed
by the higher levels to affect the decisions at the
lower levels, Such an analysis would reveal a
much more complex picture of the decision.
making process than any enumeration of the
geographical locations of organizational units at
the different levels,

Administrative description suffers currently
from. superficiality, oversimplification, lack of
realism. It has confined itself too closely to the
mechanism of authority and has failed to bring
within its orbit the other, equally important,
modes of influence on organizational behavior.
It has refused to undertake the tiresome task of
studying the actual allocation of decision-
making functions. It has been satisfied to speak

Does this mean that a Purely f

zation’s decisions? This is a question that i
almost impossible to answer in the present state
of knowledge of administrative theory. Ons
thing seems certain: content plays a greater tole
in the application of administrative principles
than is allowed for in the formal administrative
theory of the present time. This is a fact that is
beginning to be recognized in the literature of
administration. If one examines the chain of
publications extending from Mooney an
Reilley, through Gulick and the Presidents
Committee controversy, to Schuyler Wallace
and Benson, he sees a steady shift of emphasis
from the “principles of administration” them-

"selves to a study of the conditions under whic

competing principles are respectively applice-
ble. Recent publications seldom say that “org
nization should be by purpose,’ but rather that
“under such and such conditions purpose org
nization is desirable” It is to these conditions
which underlie the application of the proverbs
of administration that administrative theory
and analysis must turn in their search for really
valid principles to replace the proverbs.

The Diagnosis of Administrative Situ
tions Before any positive suggestions can

consider more closely the exact nature

A fundamental principle of administer

Article 18 | The Proverbs of Administration | 145

ment of adiministrative objectives; and among
several alternatives that lead to the same
accomplishment that one should be selected
which involves the least expenditure. Since this
“principle of efficiency” is characteristic of any
activity that attempts rationally to maximize the
attainment of certain ends with the use of scarce
means, it is as characteristic of economic theory
as it is of administrative theory. The “adminis-
trative man” fakes his place alongside the classi-
cal “economic man?!

Actually, the “principle” of efficiency should
be considered a definition rather than a princi-
ple: it is a definition of what is meant by “good”
or “correct” administrative behavior. It does not
tell kow accomplishments are to be maximized,
but merely states that this maximization is the
aim of administrative activity, and that admin-
istrative theory must disclose under what con-
ditions the maximization takes place.

Now what are the factors that determine
the level of efficiency which is achieved by an
administrative organization? It is not possible
to make an exhaustive list of these but the prin-
cipal categories can be enumerated. Perhaps
the simplest method of approach is to consider
the single member of the administrative orga-
nization and ask what the limits are to the
quantity and quality of his output. These limits
include (a) limits on his ability to perform and
(P) limits on his ability to make correct deci-
sions. To the extent that these limits are
removed, the administrative organization
approaches its goal of high efficiency. Two per-
sons, given the same skills, the same objectives
and values, the same knowledge and informa-
tion, can rationally decide only upon the same
course of action. Hence, administrative theory
must be interested in the factors that will deter-
tine with what skills, values, and knowledge
the organization member undertakes his work.
These are the “limits” to rationality with which
the principles of administration must deal.

On one side, the individual is limited by
those skills, habits, and reflexes which are no
longer in the realm of the conscious. His perfor-
mance, for example, may be limited by his man-
ual dexterity or his reaction time or his strength.
His decision-making processes may be limited
by the speed of his mental processes, his skill in
elementary arithmetic, and so forth. In this

area, thé principles of administration must be
concerned with the physiology of the human
body and with the laws of skill-training and of
habit. This is the field that has been most suc-
cessfully cultivated by the followers of Taylor
and in which has been developed time-and-
motion study and the therblig.

On a second side, the individual is limited
by his values and those conceptions of purpose
which influence him in making his decisions, If
his loyalty to the organization is high, his deci-
sions may evidence sincere acceptance of the
objectives set for the organization; if that lovalty
is lacking, personal motives may interfere with
his administrative efficiency. If his loyalties are
attached to the bureau by which he is employed,
he may sometimes make decisions that are
inirnical to the larger unit of which the burean is
a part. In this area the principles of administra-
tion must be concerned with the determinants
of loyalty and morale, with leadership and ini-
tiative, and with the influences that determine
where the individual's organizational loyalties
will be attached,

On a third side, the individual is limited by
the extent of his knowledge of things relevant to
his job. This applies both to the basic knowl-
edge required in decision making—a bridge
designer must know the fundamentals of
mechanics—and to the information that is
required to make his decisions appropriate to
the given situation. In this area, administrative
theory is concerned with such fundamental
questions as these: What are the limits on the
mass of knowledge that human minds can
accumulate and apply? How rapidly can knowl-
edge be assimilated? How is specialization in
the administrative organization to be related to
the specializations of knowledge that are preva-
lent in the community's occupational structure?
How is the system of commumication to chan-
nel knowledge and information to the
appropriate decision-points? What types of
knowledge can, and what types cannot, be eas-
ily transmitted? How is the need for intercom-
munication of information affected by the
modes of specialization in the organization?
This is perhaps the terra incognita of adminis-
trative theory, and undoubtedly its careful
exploration will cast great light on the proper
application of the proverbs of administration,
146 Part Two i The New Deal to Mid-Century ‘ 19305 To 19505 |

Perhaps this triangle of limits does not com-
pletely bound the area of rationality, and other
sides need to be added to the figure. In any case,
this enumeration will serve to indicate the kinds
of considerations that must go into the con-
struction of valid and non-contradictory prin-
ciples of administration,

An important fact to be kept in mind is that
the limits of rationality are variable limits. Most
important of all, consciousness of the limits may
in itself alter them, Suppose it were discovered
in a particular organization, for example, that
organizational loyalties attached to smail units
had frequently led to a harmful degree of intra-
Organizational competition. Then, a program
which trained members of the organization to
be conscious of their loyalties, and to subordi-
nate loyalties to the smaller group to those of the
large, might lead to a very considerable altera-
tion of the limits in that organization.5

A related point is that the term “rational

behavior,” as employed here, refers to rationality

when that behavior is evaluated in terms of the
objectives of the larger organization; for, as just
pointed out, the difference in direction of the
individual's aims from those of the larger orga-
nization is just one of those elements of nonra-
tionality with which the theory must deal.

A final observation is that, since administra-
tive theory is concerned with the non-rational
limits of the rational, it follows that the larger the
area in which rationality has been achieved the
less important is the exact form of the adminis-
trative organization. For example, the function
of plan preparation, or design, if it results in
a written plan that can be communicated
interpersonally without difficulty, can be located
almost anywhere in the organization without
affecting results, All that is needed is a proce-
due whereby the plan can be given authorita-
tive status, and this can be Provided in a number
of ways. A discussion, then, of the Proper
location for a planning or designing unit is apt
to be highly inconclusive and is apt to hinge on
the personalities in the Organization and their
relative enthusiasm, or lack of it, toward the
planning function rather than upon any abstract
principles of good administration '6

On the other hand, when factors of commu-
nication or faiths or loyalty are crucial to the
making ofa decision, the location of the decision
in the organization is of gteat importance, The

method of allocating decisions in the arm

instance, automatically provides (at least Yb
period prior to the actual battle) that each tb
sion will be made where the knowledge is oe
able for coordinating it with other decisiong

Assigning Weights to the Criteria
step, then, in the overhauling of the PlOverhs
administration is to develop a vocabyy, ary, aly af
the lines just suggested, for the description of
administrative organization, 4 Second y
which has also been outlined, is to study the
limits of rationality in order to develop a com.
plete and comprehensive enumeration of the
criteria that must be weighed in evaluating ay
administrative organization. The Current proy.
erbs represent only a fragmentary and Unsys,
tematized portion of these criteria.

When these two tasks have been carried
out, it remains to assign weights to the Crite-
tia. Since the criteria, or “proverbs.” are often
mutually competitive or contradictory, it is
not sufficient merely to identify them
Merely to know, for example, that a specified
change in organization will reduce the span
of control is not enough to justify the change
This gain must be balanced against the possible
Tesulting loss of contact between the higher and
lower ranks of the hierarchy.

Hence, administrative theory must also be
concerned with the question of the weights that
are to be applied to these criteria—to the prob-
lems of their relative importance in any con-
crete situation. This question is not one that can
be solved in a vacuum. Armchair philosophiz

necessary that the objectives of the administra-
tive organization under study be defined in
concrete terms so that results, expressed in
terms of these objectives, can be accurately
measured. Second, it is necessary that suffi-
cient experimental control be exercised to
make possible the isolation of the particular
effect under study from other disturbing fac-
tors that might be operating on the organiza-
tion at the same time.

These two conditions have seldom been
even partially fulfilled in so-called “administra-
tive experiments.’ The mere fact that a legisla-
ture passes a law creating an administrative
agency, that the agency operates for five years,
that the agency is finally abolished, and that a
historical study is then made of the agency's
operations is not sufficient to make of that
agency’s history an “administrative experi-
ment” Modern American legislation is full of
such “experiments” which furnish orators in
neighboring states with abundant ammunition
when similar issues arise in their bailiwicks, but
which provide the scientific investigator with
little or nothing in the way of objective evi-
dence, one way or the other.

In the literature of administration, there are
only a handful of research studies that satisfy
these fundamental conditions of methodology—
and these are, for the most part, on the
periphery of the problem of organization. There
are, first of all, the studies of the Taylor group
which sought to determine the technological
conditions of efficiency. Perhaps none of these
is a better example of the painstaking methods
of science than Taylor's own studies of the cut-
ting of metals!”

Studies dealing with the human and social
aspects of administration are even rarer than
the technological studies. Among the more
important are the whole series of studies on
fatigue, starting in Great Britain during World
War I and culminating in the Westinghouse
experiments.!®

In the field of public administration, almost
the sole example of such experimentation is the
Series of studies that have been conducted in the
public welfare field to determine the proper
case loads for social workers.!?

Because, apart from these scattered exam-
Ples, studies of administrative agencies have
been carried out without benefit of control or of

objective measurement of results, they have had
to depend for their recommendations and con-
clusions upon a priori reasoning proceeding
from “principles of administration” The reasons
have already been stated why the “principles”
derived in this way cannot be more than
“proverbs”

Perhaps the program outlined here will
appear an ambitious or even a quixotic one.
There should certainly be no illusions, in
undertaking it, as to the length and deviousness
of the path. It is hard to see, however, what alter-
native remains open. Certainly neither the
Practitioner of administration nor the theoreti-
cian can be satisfied with the poor analytic tools
that the proverbs provide him. Nor is there any
Teason to believe that a less drastic reconversion
than that outlined here will rebuild those tools
to usefulness,

It may be objected that administration can-
not aspire to be a “science”; that by the nature of
its subject it cannot be more than an “art”
Whether true or false, this objection is irrele-
vant to the present discussion. The question of
how “exact” the principles of administration
can be made is one that only experience can
answer. But as to whether they should be logical
or illogical there can be no debate. Even an “art”
cannot be founded on proverbs.

NOTES

1. Lest it be thought that this deficiency is pecu-
liar to the science—or “art”—of administra-
tion, it should be pointed out that the same
trouble is shared by most Freudian psycho-
logical theories, as well as by some sociologi-
cal theories.
